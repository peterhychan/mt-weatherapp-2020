# Weather App in React

### My Reflection on [dev.io](https://dev.to/peterhychan/a-weather-app-with-monetization-feature-517g).

### The demo is deployed on [now.sh](https://mt-weatherapp-2020.hoychanan.now.sh/).

## About

This is a GitHub repo for Monetization Hackathon Submission. It is a application which is an example demonstrates how we can integrate Monetization API with a React.js application.

### How it works

This is a front-end application which is written in `React.js` via `create-react-app`. The application is styled by `Bootstrap 4`.

## Features

- Web user interface using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for templating and Bootstrap for UI
- User interface to send info to request realtime weather data.
- Project specific environment variables using `.env`.

## Set up

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone <url>
cd mt-weatherapp-2020
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

3. Set your environment variables

You may setup the `.env` file, which is the only file consumes environment variables in this application.

4. Run the application

```bash
yarn start
```

5. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it!
